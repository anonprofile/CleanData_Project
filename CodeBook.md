#Code Book: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This code book describes the data, the variables, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data.

##Description of the original data source

The tidy dataset produced by the script **run_analysis.R** is derived from the **Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set (UCI HAR Dataset)**.

* Original data: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
* Description of the original data: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The experiments were carried out on a group of 30 volunteers between 19 and 48 years of age. The volunteers performed six activites while wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist: WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, and LAYING. Through the smartphone's embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, the experiment was able to capture 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. After the dataset was formed, 70% of the volunteers were randomly assigned to the training data and 30% to the test data. 

Consult the UCI HAR Dataset **README.txt** file for further details about this dataset.

##Preparation and transformations on the data source

**1. Obtain the source dataset and prepare R.**
  1. Download the source data from the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set" (UCI HAR Dataset).
  2. Unzip the dataset to the subfolder "UCI HAR Dataset" in the working directory.
  3. Ensure the following files exist in the "UCI HAR Dataset" subfolder:
    * activity_labels.txt
    * features.txt
    * /train/subject_train.txt
    * /train/X_train.txt
    * /train/y_train.txt
    * /test/subject_test.txt
    * /test/X_test.txt
    * /test/y_test.txt 
  4. Install the reshape2 R package if necessary.
  5. Run the run_analysis.R script from the working directory.

**2. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.**
  1. Read in all of the source data files with the read.table() function and assign column names:
    * features       <-  features.txt
    * activityLabels <-  activity_labels.txt
    * subjectTrain   <-  subject_train.txt
    * xTrain         <-  x_train.txt (use features[,2] as column names)
    * yTrain         <-  y_train.txt
    * subjectTest    <-  subject_test.txt
    * xTest          <-  x_test.txt (use features[,2] as column names)
    * yTest          <-  y_test.txt
  2. Create the training dataset "dataTrain" by merging subjectTrain, xTrain, and yTrain using column bind.
  3. Create the test dataset "dataTest" by merging subjectTest, xTest, and yTest using column bind.
  4. Merge the training and test datasets using row bind to create a single dataset "dataMerged".

**3. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.**

  Assumption: Mean and standard deviation columns of interest end with either .mean or .std; the meanFreq columns are excluded.
  1. Create a logical vector using grepl to indicate columns to retain (Subject, Activity, and mean and standard deviation columns). 
  2. Subset "dataMerged" by the logical vector of column names. 

**4. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.**

  Merge the activity labels into "dataMerged" by the activityID column and remove the now obsolete activityID column.

**5. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.**

  Clean up the column names in "dataMerged", removing unecessary spaces and expanding on some abbreviations:
  * std = stddev
  * t = time
  * f = freq
  * Mag = Magnitude
  * Acc = Acceleration
  * Gyro = Gyroscope  
  * BodyBody = Body

**6. Create a second, independent tidy data set from the data set created in step 4. The new tidy data set contains the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. The data set is written to a tab-delimited file called tidy.txt and has been uploaded to this repository.**
  1. Summarize "dataMerged" on the mean of each variable for each activity label and subject ID pair
  2. Reshape "dataMerged" with melt to transform the data into the long narrow form of tidy data and move the Subject column to the first position
  4. Write the tidy dataset to tab-delimited file tidy.txt in the working directory

##Tidy dataset variables
The variables of the tidy dataset are listed in order of occurence. The tidy dataset is in the long narrow form of tidy data and contains four variables (columns). Each row consists of a unique Subject/Activity/Feature group. See the Project FAQ section on "Is the wide or narrow form of the data tidy?" for more information on tidy forms of data (https://class.coursera.org/getdata-007/forum/thread?thread_id=49). 

###Subject
Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity, ranging from 1 to 30 (categorical integer).

###Activity
The activity label for the activity performed by each subject (categorical factor):

* LAYING 
* SITTING
* STANDING
* WALKING
* WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
* WALKING_UPSTAIRS

###Feature
The feature measurements come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ (categorical factor):
